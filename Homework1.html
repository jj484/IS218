    Hey there, my name is Jaysen Javier. I am a junior studying Information
    Technologies(IT) and Business Information Systems(BIS) at NJIT. 
    I'm an aspiring musician/producer that focuses on lofi and metalcore genres.
    You can listen a song off of my upcoming EP, <a class="nostyle" href="./LCR__Down_Bad.mp3">here</a>.
    I blog here on the side about traveling, video games, and investing.

      When traveling, I prefer road tripping as opposed to flying or any other means.
      I hope to travel from the East coast to the West coast US one day. In regards to investing, I
      follow a strategy called core and satellite investing, also known as core-satellite
      investing. This investment strategy revolves around the core which typically follows
      an index fund such as an S&P500, and the satellites, which are typically individual stocks,
      or more aggressive index funds.
